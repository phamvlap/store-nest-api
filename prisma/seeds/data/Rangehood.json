            "**Quieter extraction\u00a053dBA** -\u00a0Using innovative technology, this hood efficiently clears your kitchen of cooking odours and vapours at a low noise level of 53dBA, even on high speed. This provides you with a quieter cooking environment without compromising on extraction performance.",
            "**A fresher kitchen, hands-free**\u00a0\\- The wireless Hob2Hood function automatically adjusts your hood settings based on what you are cooking, leaving your hands free to focus on the food. The hood lights will automatically illuminate when your hob turns on and the fan speed will adjust depending on how powerfully you are cooking with the hob. The hood can also be controlled manually if you would prefer.",
            "**Why not turn up the power**\u00a0\\- When intensely fragranced foods such as onions and garlic hit smoking oil in the wok or pan, it's time to use PowerBoost. Simply increase the airflow power for a minute to quickly remove smoke and strong odours",
            "**Perfectly illuminated surface**\u00a0\\- Bright LED lighting clearly illuminates your hob and is also more energy efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional halogen lighting.",
            "**Clear the kitchen air** - The delay-off function will activate after you have turned off your hood to continue eliminating odours and keep your kitchen smelling fresh after cooking. So, while you are eating, the hood will switch off automatically after 5-15 minutes.",
            "**So easy to clean** - For an extractor to work efficiently the filters need to be clean and free from the cooking grease that builds up over time. All AEG filters are dishwasher-safe, making cleaning as simple as possible, whilst also being better for the environment than single use filters."

            "**Cooking is better in silence** - Ensure your rangehood is whisper quiet with an off-board motor. Installing the motor in the space between your ceiling and roof and then venting externally provides you with a quieter and more enjoyable cooking experience, without compromising on power.",
            "**High performance filter system** - The durable stainless steel baffle filter efficiently extracts vapours, absorbs odours, and filters grease to prevent build-up and optimise the airflow in your kitchen. It\u2019s easy to remove and is also dishwasher safe.",
            "**A fresher kitchen. Hands-free** - The wireless Hob2Hood function automatically adjusts your hood settings based on what you are cooking, leaving your hands free to focus on the food. The hood lights will automatically illuminate when your hob turns on and the fan speed will adjust depending on how powerfully you are cooking with the hob. The hood can also be controlled manually if you would prefer.",
            "**Powerful extraction** - Whether you are searing steaks or wilting spinach, it\u2019s important to maintain clean and fresh air in your kitchen while cooking. With a 775m3/hr extraction rate, this hood quickly removes vapours so you can enjoy cooking without distraction.",
            "**Perfectly illuminated surfaces -** Bright LED lighting clearly illuminates your hob and is also more energy efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional halogen lighting.",
            "**So easy to clean** - For an extractor to work efficiently the filters need to be clean and free from the cooking grease that builds up over time. All AEG filters are dishwasher-safe, making cleaning as simple as possible, whilst also being better for the environment than single use filters."

            "**Cooking is better in silence** - Ensure your rangehood is whisper quiet with an off-board motor. Installing the motor in the space between your ceiling and roof and then venting externally provides you with a quieter and more enjoyable cooking experience, without compromising on power.",
            "**High performance filter system** - The durable stainless steel baffle filter efficiently extracts vapours, absorbs odours, and filters grease to prevent build-up and optimise the airflow in your kitchen. It\u2019s easy to remove and is also dishwasher safe.",
            "**A fresher kitchen. Hands-free** - The wireless Hob2Hood function automatically adjusts your hood settings based on what you are cooking, leaving your hands free to focus on the food. The hood lights will automatically illuminate when your hob turns on and the fan speed will adjust depending on how powerfully you are cooking with the hob. The hood can also be controlled manually if you would prefer.",
            "**Powerful extraction** - Whether you are searing steaks or wilting spinach, it\u2019s important to maintain clean and fresh air in your kitchen while cooking. With a 775m3/hr extraction rate, this hood quickly removes vapours so you can enjoy cooking without distraction.",
            "**Perfectly illuminated surfaces** - Bright LED lighting clearly illuminates your hob and is also more energy efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional halogen lighting.",
            "**So easy to clean** - For an extractor to work efficiently the filters need to be clean and free from the cooking grease that builds up over time. All AEG filters are dishwasher-safe, making cleaning as simple as possible, whilst also being better for the environment than single use filters."

The recessed filters are positioned inside the hood to prevent condensation, which typically occurs when a Qasair rangehood is installed lower than 750 mm over an induction cooktop.  \n  \nQasair Eastmore rangehoods are 330 mm deep to work effectively over induction cooktops. Available in widths from 600 mm to 1200 mm, and fitted with one or two Qasair motors, the twin motor hoods have a maximum air movement of 1800 cubic metres of air per hour.  \n  \nThe Eastmore rangehood is manufactured from type 304 stainless steel, and features LED lights, located at the front of the hood. It is fitted with dishwasher-safe metal mesh filters designed to capture small and large grease particles, and which have a resistance to airflow of 30 Pascals to dramatically reduce the noise. The Eastmore rangehood is fitted with Megasorber sound-absorbing panels, to ensure quiet operation.",

It features a powerful European-made offboard motor and 1200m3/h airflow capacity for maximum performance and efficiency. This advanced rangehood also includes 10mm baffle filters, induction safe materials, LED lighting, and a stainless steel construction for durability and longevity. The stainless steel canopy allows for easy cleaning and ventilation prevention across the entire kitchen space. The well-balanced design facilitates an even distribution of air throughout your kitchen while keeping sound levels low with its advanced offboard solution.</td></tr><tr><th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">Brand</th><td class=\"col data\" itemprop=\"brand\">Sirius</td></tr><tr><th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">SKU/Product ID</th><td class=\"col data\">SLEM2900</td></tr><tr><th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">Features</th><td class=\"col data\"><ul><li><strong>10mm Baffle Filters</strong> - Sirius Baffle filters are particularly well-regarded for their advanced design; they feature interlocking baffles that form a tortuous route which is highly effective at trapping oil, grease, and other contaminants. Constructed from 304 grade stainless steel, these commercial-style filters are robust, durable, and easy to clean. Plus, they can be placed in the dishwasher for an effortless sanitization process.</li><li><strong>1200M3/H Airflow</strong> -&#160;With an impressive maximum airflow of 1200M3/H, this rangehood quickly and effectively removes smoke, steam, heat, odours, and other airborne particles from the kitchen. Not only does this rangehood boast great performance, but it also features a comprehensive four-fan speed control, allowing users to customize the operation of their hood according to their cooking needs.</li><li><strong>Induction Safe</strong> -&#160;Induction technology uses the base of the pan or pot to become the heat source for cooking. When using an induction cooktop, very little ambient heat is produced compared to gas. This means that little of the moisture and steam from cooking is evaporated and so hits the cold filters of the rangehood. This can pool and drip down if the unit doesn\u2019t have sufficient extraction and baffle filters.</li><li><strong>Led Lighting</strong> -&#160;LED lights emit less heat than traditional lighting, meaning they require less energy to operate. They also have a much longer lifespan, which reduces the need for frequent bulb replacements and the associated costs. This makes them an excellent choice for anyone looking to make their home more environmentally friendly while still getting excellent lighting quality.</li><li><strong>Handcrafted in Italy</strong> -&#160;Sirius Rangehoods is a luxury brand of rangehoods that are hand-crafted in Italy. Established in 1996 in Sassoferrato, Sirius has established itself as a leading manufacturer of top end rangehoods due to its bold, innovative designs and its commitment to using only the finest materials and craftsmanship.</li><li><strong>Offboard European Made Motor</strong> - Sirius has devised a simple yet effective way of providing a well-ventilated kitchen without the unpleasant noise. We call it the Sirius External Motor (SEM), where is the motor is located outside of the rangehood which reduces the amount of noise. Sirius are so confident in their motors that they offer customers peace of mind with their extensive 10-year warranty - so you can be assured of optimal performance for years to come.&#160;<strong>Please note: Motor is not included.

It is suitable for gas cooktops up to 600mm wide, providing powerful ventilation with a 1930m3/h airflow. In addition, the unit has 6.2W LED light strip to further illuminate your kitchen while you cook. The rangehood is crafted from premium aluminium filters, ensuring that it can handle high temperatures and any grease from cooking. Moreover, the sleek installation of this rangehood is the perfect fit for a minimalistic kitchen.",

            "**Green Energy Single Aluminium Bi-Power Motor** -\u00a0The most important element in the performance of your hood is the motor. Sirius has worked in-house with expert suppliers to provide a green energy motor that still provides the correct power and pressure with excellent flow levels and sound insulation.",
            "**25mm Stainless Steel Baffle** -\u00a0Sirius Baffle filters are particularly well-regarded for their advanced design; they feature interlocking baffles that form a tortuous route which is highly effective at trapping oil, grease, and other contaminants. Constructed from 304 grade stainless steel, these commercial-style filters are robust, durable, and easy to clean. Plus, they can be placed in the dishwasher for an effortless sanitization process.",
            "**1930M3/H Airflow** - With a twin motor this rangehood's impressive maximum airflow of 1930M3/H, quickly and effectively removes smoke, steam, heat, odours, and other airborne particles from the kitchen. Not only does this rangehood boast great performance, but it also features a comprehensive four-fan speed control, allowing users to customize the operation of their hood according to their cooking needs.",
            "**Induction Safe** -\u00a0Induction technology uses the base of the pan or pot to become the heat source for cooking. When using an induction cooktop, very little ambient heat is produced compared to gas. This means that little of the moisture and steam from cooking is evaporated and so hits the cold filters of the rangehood. This can pool and drip down if the unit doesn\u2019t have sufficient extraction and baffle filters.",
            "**Dynamic Lighting -**\u00a0This rangehood has Dynamic Lighting System meaning you can adjust the kelvin light temperature or warmth to match other lighting temperatures in the room. The range of Kelvin that can be selected is 2700 to 6500. Sirius Rangehoods have a maximum temperature that is 40% brighter. Dynamic Lighting also allows you to dim the light to create the perfect mood lighting.",
            "**Handcrafted in Italy -**\u00a0Sirius Rangehoods is a luxury brand of rangehoods that are hand-crafted in Italy. Established in 1996 in Sassoferrato, Sirius has established itself as a leading manufacturer of top end rangehoods due to its bold, innovative designs and its commitment to using only the finest materials and craftsmanship.",

            "**4 Speed settings**\u00a0\u00a0Sirius Rangehoods offers a variety of powerful features, including four different speed settings that allow you to customize the ventilation power for your cooking needs."

With Flex Design, adaptable elements from separately selectable accessory sets can be changed as often as you like, giving each appliance a lifetime of great taste.",
            "**Quiet and calm in the kitchen** - NEFF's Efficient Drive motor brings harmony to the kitchen. It\u2019s whisper-quiet and powerful too. Now you can focus on your cooking, and your guests, while your extractor keeps your kitchen calm, clean and serene.",

Instead of touching the controls, leave the Automatic Air Sensor in charge so you can focus on your delicate dishes. It automatically monitors the air quality and adapts the ventilation power level to the amount of vapour and odours. When you\u2019ve finished cooking, the blower continues to run until the kitchen air is cleared of all unpleasant odours.",

NEFF's Cooktop-based Hood Control lets you set different extraction levels and adjust the hood\u2019s lighting via your hob.

With LED Lighting Temperature, you can adjust your rangehood's lights to the desirable warmth or coolness without having to sacrifice quality illumination. That way you can cook with precision and comfort - a combination no cook should live without. It's a bright way to keep your kitchen as unique and creative as you are!",
            "**Touch Control gives your touch control of power** - An easy way to give you direct acces to the power and control. With Touch Control you can quickly select and adjust your hood's lights and power settings.

It boasts a motor that can generate up to 1200m3/h of airflow, as well as 10mm baffle filters and induction-safe technology. It features an off-board european-made motor, allowing you to place it away from the unit, in a silent operation without losing the full 1200m3/h extraction. LED lighting helps to complete the look, making this an ideal choice for those who want their rangehood to be both beautiful and functional. In addition, its design is versatile enough to fit most kitchen layouts and suit all tastes.</td></tr><tr><th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">Brand</th><td class=\"col data\" itemprop=\"brand\">Sirius</td></tr><tr><th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">SKU/Product ID</th><td class=\"col data\">SLTCEM92G900</td></tr><tr><th class=\"col label\" scope=\"row\">Features</th><td class=\"col data\"><ul><li><strong>10mm Baffle Filters</strong> -&#160;Sirius Baffle filters are particularly well-regarded for their advanced design; they feature interlocking baffles that form a tortuous route which is highly effective at trapping oil, grease, and other contaminants. Constructed from 304 grade stainless steel, these commercial-style filters are robust, durable, and easy to clean. Plus, they can be placed in the dishwasher for an effortless sanitization process.</li><li><strong>1200M3/H Airflow</strong> -&#160;With an impressive maximum airflow of 1200M3/H, this rangehood quickly and effectively removes smoke, steam, heat, odours, and other airborne particles from the kitchen. Not only does this rangehood boast great performance, but it also features a comprehensive four-fan speed control, allowing users to customize the operation of their hood according to their cooking needs.</li><li><strong>Induction Safe</strong> -&#160;Induction technology uses the base of the pan or pot to become the heat source for cooking. When using an induction cooktop, very little ambient heat is produced compared to gas. This means that little of the moisture and steam from cooking is evaporated and so hits the cold filters of the rangehood. This can pool and drip down if the unit doesn\u2019t have sufficient extraction and baffle filters.</li><li><strong>Led Lighting</strong> -&#160;LED lights emit less heat than traditional lighting, meaning they require less energy to operate. They also have a much longer lifespan, which reduces the need for frequent bulb replacements and the associated costs. This makes them an excellent choice for anyone looking to make their home more environmentally friendly while still getting excellent lighting quality.</li><li><strong>Handcrafted in Italy</strong> -&#160;Sirius Rangehoods is a luxury brand of rangehoods that are hand-crafted in Italy. Established in 1996 in Sassoferrato, Sirius has established itself as a leading manufacturer of top end rangehoods due to its bold, innovative designs and its commitment to using only the finest materials and craftsmanship.</li><li><strong>Offboard European Made Motor</strong> -&#160;Sirius has devised a simple yet effective way of providing a well-ventilated kitchen without the unpleasant noise. We call it the Sirius External Motor (SEM), where is the motor is located outside of the rangehood which reduces the amount of noise. Sirius are so confident in their motors that they offer customers peace of mind with their extensive 10-year warranty - so you can be assured of optimal performance for years to come.&#160;&#160;<strong>Please note: Motor is not included.

There are no distractions when cooking and no interruptions when entertaining.</li><li><strong>Simple cleaning</strong> - All parts that come into contact with cooking vapours can be easily removed through the accessible, wide inlet opening. They can then be cleaned in the dishwasher, where they take up very little space.</li><li><strong>Integrated grease drip pan</strong> - If anything is spilt during cooking, the integrated drip tray safely catches both solids and liquids.</li><li><strong>Genuine stainless steel grease filter</strong> - Compared to other frequently-used filter materials, such as aluminium, the stainless steel grease filter will not perish with ongoing cleaning in the dishwasher, retaining its original appearance (no yellowing) and stability.</li><li><strong>Modular system</strong> - The extractor system can be freely combined with up to 8 different cooktops from surface induction to gas or Tepan. Multiple combinations with, for example, 3 cooktops and 2 extractors are also possible.</li><li><strong>Automatic extractor control</strong> - The extractor power level automatically adjusts itself according to current cooking conditions. There\u2019s no need for constant manual adjustment, which means you can focus fully on your cooking.</li><li>Suitable for use as a recirculation or exhaust system</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>",
