Lower heat and controlled movement mean that everything from delicates to outdoor wear can be carefully washed and dried in one go. Both washing and drying cycles are certified by Woolmark Blue to safely clean even hand-wash only woollens in one process. For outdoor wear, a dedicated wash cycle cleans and protects technical fabrics to preserve their textures over time; and a dedicated dry cycle works to restore water repellency.",
            "**Perfect drying, best in class in efficiency** - With our heat pump technology, the OKOKombi washer dryer has a 7 Star energy rating for drying and reduces running costs without compromising results. To minimise water usage, the warm air condenser requires just a litre of water to begin the drying process, yet consumes no water during the drying phase.",
            "**Safe, low temperatures** - Dry heat pump technology dries with low temperatures and uses precise sensors to monitor the drying cycle. This ensures that fabrics are never subject to unnecessary heat meaning your clothes will keep the textures they had for longer.",
            "**Every fibre cleaned and protected** - Advanced OKOMix technology blends detergents and then softeners with water before they enter the drum. This ensures that every fibre is cleaned and cared for with the right mix of detergent, even for shorter cycles. Every thread, every stitch, every fibre, is expertly protected.",
            "**Caring for clothes, saving water and energy** - ProSense technology intelligent sensors optimises and displays the estimated wash time within 30 seconds of starting the wash cycle. Whether it is a few shirts or your entire weekly laundry, the wash time, water and energy consumption adjust to ensure they are only washed for the exact amount of time required. This ensures that fabrics suffer less wear and tear, maintaining colour and texture.",
            "**Keeps your clothes looking and feeling impeccable** - The steam refresh program enables you to refresh your garments without the need to wash with detergent and water. This ensures less wear and tear on fibres so they can maintain their look and textures for longer.",
            "**The gentle way to care for wool** - The Woolmark Blue certification in both washing and drying will treat each item in the gentlest possible manner, meaning you can safely wash and dry all of your hand wash woollen garments."
