So, when it comes to designing their dishwashers for use at home, they take the same approach and apply the same rigorous standards regarding performance, reliability and quality.</li><li><strong>More steel less plastic</strong> - The main components of ASKO\u2019s dishwashers are manufactured using high-quality steel instead of plastic. We think that quality is paramount, and we think you do the same.</li><li><strong>Super Cleaning</strong> - Rinse the dishes. Clean the interior, including the filter. Choose the best program. How many steps is that? One \u2013 and ASKO call it the Super Cleaning System \u2013 or their best invention.</li><li><strong>Self cleaning</strong> - ASKO\u2019s dishwashers have a Self-cleaning program to ensure that all vital parts are thoroughly cleaned. Use a recommended cleaning agent and the program on a regular basis for best result.</li><li><strong>Turbo Combi Drying</strong> - Turbo Combi Drying\u2122 benefits from both the innovative Turbo Drying\u2122 system and natural drying with dry indoor air. Our Turbo Drying\u2122 system begins the drying process and is followed with the door automatically opens to finish the drying with indoor air.</li><li><strong>Status Light</strong> -&#160;ASKO\u2019s new generation dishwashers have Status Light\u2122 -a small light placed in the bottom right corner to let you know the actual status of the program.</li><li><strong>Auto door open</strong> - When a program is completed, the Door Pop-Out function opens the dishwasher door automatically to remove the steam inside.</li><li><strong>Flexiracks</strong> - ASKO Flexiracks\u2122 are constructed from sturdy, nylon coated steel and are easily adjustable in different heights depending on which type of load you have.</li><li><strong>InstantLift</strong> \u2013 ASKO\u2019s InstantLift\u2122 height adjustment system, allows for freeing up between 40 and 58mm in the upper basket,. A simple and flexible way to make room for everything.</li><li><strong>XL Dishwasher</strong> - ASKO's XL dishwashers have a loading height of 54cm. Combined with the smart four level rack system the load is 40% more, with countless possibilities to make it all fit in.</li><li><strong>Knife holders</strong> - Knives are sensitive things, so too are fingers. That is why we have done everything possible to protect both as best we can. Our knife holder is extra deep so that the blades remain steady throughout the wash cycle. There are knife holders on three levels: in the middle basket, in the upper basket and in the top basket. We guarantee a clean cut.</li><li><strong>Telescopic rails</strong> - ASKO uses telescopic guide rails with ball bearings to make the racks glide smoothly and quietly. For easy loading and unloading, you can also take out the whole rack.</li><li><strong>Kid Safe</strong> - To stop small fingers from starting the dishwasher, Kid Safe\u2122 makes the control panel easy to lock. This also prevents altering any settings by mistake.</li><li><strong>9 spray zones, 3 spray arms</strong> - ASKO\u2019s spray system consists of up to 9 effective spray zones to ensure a totally clean load. In the lower rack there are three power zones to take care of the dirtiest parts. The 3 spray-arm technique reaches every corner so no dirt can escape. Not even your lasagne baking dish.</li><li><strong>Programs and modes&#160;</strong>- Programs: Quick wash, Rinse and hold,&#160;Intensive,&#160;Hygiene wash,&#160;Time program,&#160;ECO wash,&#160;Anti odour,&#160;Self cleaning, and&#160;Heavy wash.

The unique hinge mechanism allows you to gently lift the lower rack, meaning you no longer need to bend down low to load and unload heavy plates, platters, pots, and pans.",
            "**Make room for more** - The MaxiFlex drawer accommodates everything from spoons to spatulas. From multiple cutlery sets to over-sized utensils, the flexible dividers mean you can customise the drawer according to the load. Flatware is kept separate from larger items and the added depth increases the capacity for each cycle.",
            "**The glass-care specialist** - SoftGrips and SoftSpikes gently support your delicate glasses, safeguarding them from damage, while the dedicated glassware program means you no longer have to hand wash. SoftGrips gently secure each individual glass stem, while the rubber SoftSpikes cushion glassware from vibration during the wash cycle so they do not move around.",
            "**Max coverage, Max clean** - SatelliteClean shoots multiple jets of water into every corner of the dishwasher to ensure every item is thoroughly cleaned. The double rotation movement continuously changes the angle of the water jets to ensure maximum coverage, delivering outstanding cleaning results.",
            "**Clean with extra hygiene** - The ExtraHygiene function gives you maximum cleaning performance with hygienic care. With the ExtraHygiene function, the final rinse phase heats up to above 60C and keeps the temperature high for minimum of 10 minutes to sanitize your dishes, removing more than 99.99% of bacteria and viruses. \\*ExtraHygiene removes more than 99.99% of bacteria and viruses with water heated above 60C. Tested for Micrococcus leteus and MS2 bacteriophage in external test performance by Swissatest Testmaterialien AG in 2021 (Test report No. 20212029)",
            "**Status check from a distance** - Beam-on-Floor projects the status of your wash program so that you can easily see when it's time to unload. A red spot on the floor means that the program is still running, while a green spot means that it is completed.",
            "**Up to 3x better drying\\*** - AirDry technology finishes each cycle with a breath of fresh air, performing three-times better than closed-door systems. The door automatically opens 10 cms towards the end of the drying phase, without you lifting a finger. This allows air to circulate inside, leaving plates and cutlery completely dry and spotless at the end of the cycle, whilst also saving energy. \\*Compared with Electrolux's closed system.",

That means even more adjustment options and maximum flexibility. Rackmatic also allows the dishwasher to operate with one side of the top basket angled higher or lower, allowing tall plates in the lower basket and long stem glassware in the top basket to be washed simultaneously.</li><li><strong>Extra Clean Zone</strong> \u2013 Say goodbye to heavy duty cleaning! The Extra Clean Zone provides a thorough clean for tough-to-clean items. It is located in the middle of the upper basket and once activated, the three rotating water nozzles deliver an intensive wash for items placed in the zone.</li><li><strong>Leaves your plasticware perfectly dry.</strong> - Activating the Extra Dry option dries your dishes extra-thoroughly by higher temperatures during the rinse cycle and a longer drying phase - with just one push of a button.</li><li><strong>Silence program</strong> - Nobody likes a noisy dishwasher. The Silence Plus 44 dB dishwasher can be pleasingly quiet in your home.&#160;By activating the Silence program, you automatically reduce the noise levels of your dishwasher to the lowest minimum possible. This is achieved by an especially adapted Eco 50 \u00b0C program, a reduced spray pressure and extended cleaning phase.</li><li><strong>ActiveWater</strong>&#160;- Less water and energy, better performance &amp; quality.<strong>&#160;</strong>ActiveWater is a revolutionary dishwashing system that uses every single drop of water to the maximum.&#160; All Bosch ActiveWater dishwashers undergo 200 individual quality control checks before being released from the factory.</li><li><strong>EcoSilence Drive</strong>&#160;- EcoSilence Drive wash and drain pumps work without brushes, resulting in energy efficiency, optimum wash results, and ultra-silent performance. Additionally, the drain pump cuts out as soon as the water is drained, avoiding any air intake and the loud \u2018gurgle\u2019 sound that comes with it.</li><li><strong>No more leaks</strong> - Leak protection is essential for dishwashers. Valid for the lifetime of the appliance, Bosch's Aqua Stop system delivers fail-safe leak protection. When the sensor detects a leak, the dishwasher automatically stops operating and pumps out water through a double-walled hose.</li><li><strong>Anti Fingerprint&#160;finish</strong>- With Bosch's Anti-Fingerprint solution the visibility of fingerprints on your Dishwasher is considerably reduced.</li><li><strong>Child lock</strong> - For added safety, the door can be locked manually to prevent children from inadvertently opening the door. The buttons can also be locked to prevent tampering during operation.</li><li><strong>Wash programs and options</strong> - Programs: Eco Wash, Auto Wash, Auto Gentle, Pots &amp; Pans, Quick 1hr, Express Wash, ExtraQuiet, and Favourite.&#160;Options: ExtraDry, HygienePlus, and SpeedPerfect.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>",

The PerfectDry dishwashers ensure perfect drying results using Zeolith \u2013 a natural mineral. Zeolith uses the humidity of the cleaning phase and releases it as warm, dry air during the drying phase. PerfectDry gives you cupboard-ready dishes, using low energy.</li><li><strong>Flexible, steady and easy-sliding racks</strong> - Loading your dishwasher just got a whole lot easier.

This is achieved by an especially adapted Eco 50 \u00b0C program, a reduced spray pressure and extended cleaning phase.</li><li><strong>Heavy-duty cleaning for heavily soiled dishes</strong> - Say goodbye to scrubbing and tough cleaning: the Extra Clean Zone provides a thorough clean for tough to clean items. It is located in the middle of the upper basket and once activated the three rotating water nozzles deliver an intensive wash for items placed in the zone. This means that you don\u2019t need to rewash items, add more detergent or use high temperatures. When it comes to intensive washing performance, leave the tough work to Bosch.</li><li><strong>TFT display shows all the information you need</strong> -&#160;The multi-coloured TFT display not only looks good, it also provides you with useful information throughout the wash cycle.

This spiralising directional wash sprays water evenly in a 360\u00b0 sweep.",

BORA Classic 2.0 has got you covered. Whether it\u2019s gas, induction, glass ceramic, Tepan grill or a mix, the state-of-the-art system means you can choose which cooktops and extractor systems to combine, meeting your kitchen requirements exactly.",

The perfect lines allow them to blend in discreetly and elegantly with any modern kitchen design. When on standby, the operating panel is virtually invisible and during operation it is scaled down to the essentials thanks to intelligent lighting.",
            "**Intuitive sControl+ control**\u00a0\\- The unique operating panel is simpler than ever: it works intuitively with a swipe of your index finger up or down in the smooth hollow or a tap with your fingertip. All important functions can be accessed with a single touch.",
            "**Direct function selection** -\u00a0All main functions can be directly selected using a touch control.",
            "**Minimum volume** -\u00a0Always extremely quiet, even on high power levels: this is due to optimum airflow and the use of an extremely quiet fan in the kitchen plinth area. So it won\u2019t distract you from your cooking and your conversations won\u2019t be disturbed.",
            "**Simple cleaning** -\u00a0All parts that come into contact with cooking vapours can be easily removed through the accessible, wide inlet opening. They can then be cleaned in the dishwasher, where they take up very little space.",
            "**Cleaning lock** -\u00a0When activated, the controls are locked for 10 seconds so that the surface can be cleaned. The remaining time can be seen counting down in the timer window. All device settings remain unchanged in the meantime.",
            "**Integrated grease drip pan** -\u00a0If anything is spilt during cooking, the integrated drip tray safely catches both solids and liquids.",
            "**Genuine stainless steel grease filter** -\u00a0Compared to other frequently-used filter materials, such as aluminium, the stainless steel grease filter will not perish with ongoing cleaning in the dishwasher, retaining its original appearance (no yellowing) and stability.",
            "**Compact size** -\u00a0Thanks to the compact dimensions and a cooktop depth of 515\u00a0mm, the system is suitable for standard kitchen units (60 cm from the front edge) as supplied by all current manufacturers.",
            "**Automatic extractor control** -\u00a0The extractor power level automatically adjusts itself according to current cooking conditions. There\u2019s no need for constant manual adjustment, which means you can focus fully on your cooking."

            "**Minimalistic design**\u00a0\\-\u00a0The cooktop and extractor are ideal for flush installation. The perfect lines allow them to blend in discreetly and elegantly with any modern kitchen design. When on standby, the operating panel is virtually invisible and during operation it is scaled down to the essentials thanks to intelligent lighting.",
            "**Intuitive sControl+ control**\u00a0\\- The unique operating panel is simpler than ever: it works intuitively with a swipe of your index finger up or down in the smooth hollow or a tap with your fingertip. All important functions can be accessed with a single touch.",

            "**Automatic reignition**\u00a0\\-\u00a0The gas burners are equipped with safety thermocouples. These thermocouples monitor the burner flame when the gas supply is active. If the burner flame accidentally goes out, it is automatically reignited by the device. If reignition fails, the gas supply is automatically cut off.",

            "**Low pan support height**\u00a0\\-\u00a0The exceptional cooktop design with reduced pan support height and sunken gas burners enables optimum operation with one cooktop extractor and easy handling due to the smaller size.",
            "**Automatic heat up function**\u00a0\\- When the automatic heat up function is activated, the cooking zone works for a certain length of time at full power and is then automatically restored to the continuous cooking level set.",
            "**Minimum volume**\u00a0\\-\u00a0Always extremely quiet, even on high power levels: this is due to optimum airflow and the use of an extremely quiet fan in the kitchen plinth area. So it won\u2019t distract you from your cooking and your conversations won\u2019t be disturbed.",
            "**Simple cleaning**\u00a0\\-\u00a0All parts that come into contact with cooking vapours can be easily removed through the accessible, wide inlet opening. They can then be cleaned in the dishwasher, where they take up very little space.",
            "**Cleaning lock**\u00a0\\-\u00a0When activated, the controls are locked for 10 seconds so that the surface can be cleaned. The remaining time can be seen counting down in the timer window. All device settings remain unchanged in the meantime.",

            "**Automatic extractor control**\u00a0\\-\u00a0The extractor power level automatically adjusts itself according to current cooking conditions. There\u2019s no need for constant manual adjustment, which means you can focus fully on your cooking."

A unique piece of technology with a powerful integrated extractor fan, capable of instantly removing odours. The automatic extraction function allows the rangehood to automatically change speed in accordance with power level - selecting the most appropriate extraction level for a variety of cooking styles.</li><li><strong>Flush cast iron grill</strong> - A cast iron grill lies at the centre of the HOBD hob, protecting the powerful integrated extractor fan. With no difference in the height across its surface, the glass ceramic cooktop is completely flush, so pans can be moved across it without encountering any obstacles. A few centimetres under the surface, the extraction motor instantly removes cooking odours and vapours much faster than a traditional rangehood.</li><li><strong>Autovent 2.0</strong> - Introducing Autovent 2.0: a smart technology system that uses Bluetooth to connect compatible Smeg induction cooktops to the rangehood and automatically adjusts the extraction speed based on the temperature and power of the paired induction cooktop. The rangehood will always operate at the optimal extraction level, leaving your kitchen without condensation and odours, and helping to enhance overall kitchen hygiene.</li><li><strong>Multizone flexibility</strong> - Join two cooking zones together and program settings via a single control to make cooking with larger pots and pans effortless. Every part of the zone to the edge is usable, offering safe and precise cooking without any cold spots. Cook with either four separate zones, or two large multizones for enhanced flexibility in how you cook.</li><li><strong>Touch controls</strong> - For precise cooking control, the zones are operated by a backlit white LED ergonomic slide control where you can choose to touch directly or finger swipe up and down the 1 to 9 power levels with no \u2018tapping\u2019 required</li><li><strong>Advanced Eco Logic</strong> - Save energy without compromising cooking results with the Advanced Eco Logic limitation system, enabling a minimum power draw of 2.4kW.</li><li><strong>Boost function</strong> - The Boost function provides an additional surge of power for even more intense heat, ideal for rapid boiling or stir frying. The temperature will revert to power level 9 when complete.</li><li><strong>Automatic pan detection</strong> - Fitted with a pan detection system that automatically selects the zones on which a suitable pot or pan has been placed for hassle-free operation.</li><li><strong>Neptune Grey: the new neutral</strong> - An elegant aesthetic that incorporates modern minimalistic design trends with an on-trend neutral colour, Linea is characterised by symmetrical lines, balance and light. Pair with other Linea Neptune Grey appliances to create the ultimate kitchen solution that undoubtedly blends technology with style. Any combination of premium Linea appliances will make a real style statement in the kitchen.</li><li><strong>Added peace of mind</strong> - Exceptional craftsmanship and service is coupled with an automatic five year parts and labour warranty for added peace of mind.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>",
